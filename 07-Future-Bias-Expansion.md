# Future Cognitive Vulnerabilities (Community-Led Development)

This framework defines CV-01 and CV-02 as foundational entries.  
However, the cognitive attack surface is significantly broader.

Rather than defining additional vulnerabilities unilaterally, this project adopts a **community-driven expansion model**, consistent with OWASP principles.

## 1. Why Community Expansion?
- Cognitive vulnerabilities overlap psychology, HCI, security, and AI ethics.  
- Real-world patterns emerge only through deployment and testing.  
- A collaborative approach ensures accuracy and legitimacy.

## 2. Scope for Future Entries
Future CV-entries may include:
- anchoring drift,  
- social proof illusions,  
- friction avoidance,  
- dependency bias,  
- semantic overconfidence.

But these will **not** be defined in this version.

## 3. Invitation to Contribute
Researchers, practitioners, and organizations are invited to submit:

- proposed cognitive vulnerabilities,  
- anonymized incident patterns,  
- detection signals,  
- mitigation strategies,  
- mappings to OWASP LLM Top-10.

The goal is to collaboratively build a **Cognitive Vulnerabilities Top 10**.

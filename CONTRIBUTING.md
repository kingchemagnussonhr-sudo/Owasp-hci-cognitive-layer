- Improve documentation, diagrams, and examples.

## Cognitive Vulnerability Proposal Template

When proposing a new CV entry, please include:

1. Name and short label (e.g., CV-03 Anchoring Drift Exploitation)
2. Definition (what fails cognitively?)
3. Why it matters (impact, risk scenarios)
4. Detection signals
5. Mitigations at:

# OWASP Cognitive Vulnerability Companion Framework
### A Research Framework for Human–Centered Security in LLM Applications

---

## What This Framework Is

This is a **community-driven research framework** for discovering, documenting, and validating cognitive vulnerabilities in human–AI interaction.

**We provide:**
- Structured vocabulary for discussing cognitive risks in LLM systems
- Hypothesis-driven methodology for testing mitigations
- Templates for reporting incidents and sharing findings
- A collaborative space for building evidence-based security practices

**We do NOT yet provide:**
- Validated compliance requirements
- Proven mitigation effectiveness data
- Implementation mandates
- Deployment-ready security controls

Those emerge through community contribution and empirical validation.

---

## Purpose of This Framework

Large Language Models introduce risks that do not arise solely from technical vulnerabilities. Many failures originate in **human-AI interaction**, where predictable cognitive patterns amplify technical flaws.

This framework establishes a research structure to:

1. **Identify** cognitive vulnerabilities that increase security risk
2. **Document** real-world incidents where cognition contributed to failure
3. **Propose** detection signals and mitigation strategies
4. **Test** these strategies in real deployments
5. **Validate** what actually works through shared evidence

---

##  Current Status: Version 1.0 (Research Phase)

###  What's Established

- **Core Concepts:** Foundational theory of cognitive vulnerabilities in LLM security
- **Initial Vulnerabilities:** CV-01 (Automation Bias) and CV-02 (Confirmation Bias) as starting hypotheses
- **Three-Layer Architecture:** Model–Interface–Human security framework
- **Contribution Templates:** Structured formats for sharing incidents and findings

###  What's Being Discovered

- Real-world incident patterns that validate or refute CV-01 and CV-02
- Detection signal effectiveness (which signals actually predict problems?)
- Mitigation strategy outcomes (what works? what fails? what's the cost?)
- Additional cognitive vulnerabilities beyond the initial two

###  What's Coming

- Evidence-based refinement of proposed controls
- Industry-specific guidance based on deployment data
- Validated risk severity classifications
- Potential integration into OWASP official guidance (pending validation)

---

##  Why This Framework Needs You

**This framework is intentionally incomplete.**

We've built the structure, but the content comes from community experience:

### **We Need From You:**

** Incident Reports**  
Have you seen users overtrust AI outputs? Accept biased responses? Share anonymized cases.

** Pilot Data**  
Testing mitigations in your organization? Share what worked and what didn't.

** New Vulnerabilities**  
Observed cognitive failure patterns not covered by CV-01 or CV-02? Propose them.

** Implementation Experience**  
Built detection systems? Tried adding UI friction? Tell us the real-world outcomes.

** Research Findings**  
Academic studies, user testing, A/B results - all evidence strengthens the framework.

---

##  Who This Framework Serves

### **For Security Architects**
A structured approach to discussing human factors in LLM risk models.

### **For ML Engineers**  
Specific detection signals to monitor in production systems.

### **For UX/HCI Designers**  
Evidence-based guidance on where friction helps vs. harms.

### **For AI Safety Researchers**  
Collaborative dataset of cognitive failure modes in deployed systems.

### **For Risk Managers**  
Framework for assessing human-AI interaction risks alongside technical vulnerabilities.

### **For Organizations**  
Early warning system for emerging cognitive risks before they cause incidents.

##  Relationship to OWASP LLM Top 10

This framework **complements** the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications by addressing the cognitive layer that determines whether technical vulnerabilities result in actual harm.

### **How They Connect:**

| OWASP LLM Top 10 | Cognitive Amplification |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| **LLM01: Prompt Injection** | Users may not recognize injected content due to automation bias |
| **LLM02: Insecure Output Handling** | Confirmation bias causes users to accept flawed outputs |
| **LLM08: Excessive Agency** | Automation bias leads to insufficient oversight of AI actions |
| **LLM09: Overreliance** | Direct manifestation of cognitive vulnerabilities |

**Key Principle:** Technical controls often fail at the human interface. Cognitive vulnerabilities explain *why*.

---

##  Principles Guiding This Framework

### **1. Evidence Over Assertion**
We propose hypotheses. Community provides evidence. Only validated content survives.

### **2. Transparency About Uncertainty**
Every proposed mitigation carries a status label: Hypothesis / Early Evidence / Validated / Refuted

### **3. Collaborative Discovery**
No single organization has all the answers. Security emerges through shared learning.

### **4. Practical Focus**
Academic rigor meets deployment reality. If it doesn't work in production, it doesn't belong here.

### **5. Cognitive Humility**
We're exploring complex human–AI interaction. Expect surprises, welcome refutation, update beliefs.

# Failure Modes: Why Single-Layer Controls Are Not Sufficient

Cognitive vulnerabilities cannot be mitigated by a single type of control.  
Attempts to solve the problem through only model changes, only UI changes, or only user training lead to predictable failures.

---

## 1. Overreliance on Human Training
**Failure:**
Users are trained to “think critically,” but the system still reinforces bias or overloads them cognitively.

**Result:**  
Human limitations eventually overpower training → incidents occur.

---

## 2. Overreliance on Technical Fixes
**Failure:**  
The model expresses uncertainty correctly, but overloaded users ignore warnings.

**Result:**  
Output is misused despite being technically sound.

---

## 3. Overreliance on UI/UX Fixes
**Failure:**  
Strong UI warnings exist, but users learn to click through them due to fatigue or workflow pressure.

**Result:**  
Warnings degrade into noise.

## 4. Combined-Layer Mitigation
Security emerges only when:

- the model regulates its cognitive footprint,  
- the interface provides friction and alternatives,  
- the user operates with increased awareness.

This is the core principle of the HCI Layer:  
**no single intervention is sufficient.**

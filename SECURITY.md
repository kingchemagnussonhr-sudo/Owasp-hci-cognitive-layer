# Security Policy

This project is a research and guidance framework; it does not ship production code.

If you identify issues in the examples, documentation, or recommended patterns that might create security misunderstandings or dangerous misconfigurations in real systems, please:

1. Open an Issue with a clear description, **or**
2. Contact the maintainers privately if sensitive.

Do not include proprietary or personal data in any examples or case studies.
